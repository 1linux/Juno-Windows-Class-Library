Juno Windows Class Library
==========================

This is a fork of the Juno project found on DSource.org.

Do not expect it to work! I have made it compile as a library with D2.056 and that is all. The examples don't seem to work at this time.

You can also find the original code in the D1 branch. I do not anticipate development on this and this may even be as far as I get (hope not).


Also I would like to direct attention to this commit as I'm sure it breaks something:
