Juno Windows Class Library
==========================

This is a fork of the Juno project found on DSource.org.

Do not expect it to work! I have made it compile as a library with D2.056 and that is all. The examples don't seem to work at this time.

You can also find the original code in the D1 branch. I do not anticipate development on this and this may even be as far as I get (hope not).

Compiling
---------

When compiling this library you can use

make juno

Further more the make file includes some examples

make events

make latebinding

make messagebeep

make relativepath

Of which I've only seen the last two work.
