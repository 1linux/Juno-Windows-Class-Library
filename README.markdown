Juno Windows Class Library
==========================

This is a continuation of the Juno project found on DSource.org.

I have made it compile as a library with D2.060. I've seen all examples working, so this is good news. If you need a quick easy SMTP server for the latebinding example: http://www.softstack.com/freesmtp.html

You can also find the original code in the D1 branch.

Compiling
---------

When compiling this library you can use

make juno

Further more the make file includes some examples
Suggest: https://github.com/JesseKPhillips/Juno-Windows-Class-Library/wiki/Updating-Libraries

make events

make latebinding

make messagebeep

make relativepath

Of which I've only seen the last two work.
